<b> <h2> PART 3: DESCRIPTION </h2> </b>

The basic idea of this project is to make a minimalist portfolio template for myself or other architecture students to demonstrate their skills and projects. To make this project/portfolio interactive and engaging, I decided to make smooth animations and minor visual effects across the pages. Since architecture portfolios don't usually have too many “catchy” visual ornaments, making smooth transitions and animations is my major goal for this project. The accessibility of my project is going to be simple, which means the layout and actions are going to be self-explanatory so that anyone knows what to look for and which buttons to click. 

I would include basic information about myself (such as education, skills, and work experiences) in the bio page and some pictures of my architecture projects and their design narrative in the “Projects” page. (There will be a lot of placeholders in the project sections and publication sections since I don’t have many projects done since I am a first year student in Architecture) Also, the overall minimalist layout and design of the portfolio will tell the viewers my utilitarian design principles. 

<b> <h2> PART 4: USING MY WEBSITE </h2> </b>

=> click on project to navigate to the project gallery

=> click on the picture in the gallery to find modal that provides detailed description of the item

=> click on the navigation buttons to each of the page

=> scroll the on the bio/publication text part to see more of it

<b> <h2> PART 5: EXTERNAL LIBRARIES </h2> </b>

I used bootstrap to make this project.

Reason: it provdies multiple class-based modifications so the css coding part will be much easier for me. Also I love the smooth size changes for each of the columns/units that I made.

How I used them: I just added the class name according to my needs to each of the elements of my webpage.

What did they add to my webpage: It adds some more cool visual effect to each of the pictures that I made (like shadows and smoothed edge).

<b> <h2> PART 6: ITERATIONS </h2> </b>

I added a new type of animation for page to page transitions. I changed the color theme from just black and white to black, white and yellow. Also I made the hover effect of the navigation buttons underline instead of strikethrough lines.

<b> <h2> PART 7: CHALLENGES </h2> </b>

Since I am still kind of new to HTML and CSS, most challeneges that I remember is the syntax and regular small isusses. The biggest one among them all is the transition animation that I made, which took me a lot of time to figure out how to make the background not visible during the animation through z-indexes.
